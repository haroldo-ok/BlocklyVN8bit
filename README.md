### Blockly VN for 8BitUnity

This is a mashup between [BlocklyVN32X](https://github.com/haroldo-ok/BlocklyVN32X) and [8Bit-Unity](https://github.com/8bit-Dude/8bit-Unity/). It allows you to make Visual Novels for classic 8bit computers and consoles, using a visual scripting language.

Work in progress.
